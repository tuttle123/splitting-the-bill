Bill Splitter with Random Meal Suggestion
This project is a web application designed to help users split bills among friends while factoring in tax and tip. After the calculation, it suggests a random meal for the next time users eat, using the Foodish API. The app solves the problem of complex bill splitting in group dining scenarios, ensuring that everyone pays their share, including tax and tip. As a fun bonus, it provides a random meal suggestion once the bill is calculated.

Features
Bill Splitting: Users can input each order, assign it to a friend, and the app calculates how much each person owes, including tax and tip.
Random Meal Suggestion: After calculating the bill, a random food image from the Foodish API is displayed as a meal suggestion for the next time.
Order Management: Users can add, remove, and modify individual orders before calculating the final bill.
Problem It Solves
Splitting bills in group dining can be complicated, especially when factoring in taxes and tips. This app automates the process of calculating individual amounts each friend owes. It ensures that the tax and tip are evenly distributed among friends. Additionally, the app adds a fun element by suggesting a random meal after the bill has been calculated, giving users inspiration for their next meal.

Instructions for Setting Up and Running the Project
Prerequisites

API Information
Foodish API
This project uses the Foodish API to fetch random food images. When users press the "Calculate and Suggest Next Meal" button, the app makes a GET request to the API to retrieve a random meal suggestion in the form of an image.

API Integration
The API is integrated via the following endpoint:
bash
Copy code
GET https://foodish-api.com/api/
Upon a successful response, the app extracts the image URL and displays the image on the screen as a suggested meal.
Here’s how the API is used in the code:

javascript
Copy code
const fetchMealSuggestion = async () => {
try {
const response = await fetch('https://foodish-api.com/api/');
const data = await response.json();
if (data && data.image) {
setSuggestedMeal(data.image); // Display the image
} else {
setErrorMessage('Unable to retrieve meal suggestion.');
}
} catch (error) {
setErrorMessage('Error fetching meal suggestion');
}
};
The API call is made asynchronously, and error handling is implemented to display messages in case of issues fetching the data.

Credits
This project includes code generated with the help of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The following aspects were assisted by AI:

React Component Structure: The initial structure of the App.js file was designed with suggestions from ChatGPT, which provided the component setup for managing state and logic.
Form Handling: AI-generated code was used for form input management and state handling (e.g., handling input for orders, tip, and tax).
API Integration: The integration of the Foodish API was guided by ChatGPT, including error handling and best practices for API calls.
Bill Calculation Logic: The logic for calculating the split bill, including dividing tax and tip evenly, was partially generated by AI but was customized to fit the specific needs of this project.
Validation: Input validation logic to prevent submission of empty forms was suggested by AI, helping ensure the robustness of the app.
How AI Was Used
The AI-assisted portions of the code were adapted to fit the requirements of this project. Although the AI helped generate code snippets and logic flow, manual adjustments were made to ensure the application works correctly and handles all edge cases.
