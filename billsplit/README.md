Bill Splitter with Random Meal Suggestion
This is a simple web application that allows users to split bills among friends, taking into account tip and tax, and suggests a random meal for the next time they eat using the Foodish API. Users can input orders, assign them to friends, calculate the total cost, and see how much each person should pay. After calculating the total, a random food image is displayed as a suggestion for the user's next meal.

Features
Order Input: Users can input the name and cost of a meal and assign it to a friend.
Bill Splitting: The app calculates the total bill, including tax and tip, and splits it among all friends.
Meal Suggestion: After calculating the total bill, the app fetches and displays a random food image using the Foodish API, suggesting a meal for the user's next meal.
Error Handling: The app ensures valid inputs and handles errors when fetching the meal suggestion.
